## What is Lotus Dex?

Lotus is the first native DEX for the Mantra. Lotus is deeply integrated across the Mantra EVM with most of the top protocols, tokens, and liquidity providers in the ecosystem.

LotusDex symbolizes purity, resilience, and the power to rise strong. Just like the lotus flower growing out of the mud, Lotus aims to connect Real-World Assets (RWA) with the DeFi ecosystem, bringing real value backed liquidity on-chain.

## The Vision of Lotus.

DeFi has already proven the power of decentralized finance across multiple ecosystems. But for Mantra a blockchain purpose-built for Real-World Assets (RWA) to truly thrive, it needs a native, seamless, and sustainable liquidity layer. This is why Lotus was created. At Lotus, we carry a clear vision:

- Bring the core components of DeFi onto the Mantra chain, enabling every user to access swaps, liquidity pools, and yield directly.
- Provide permissionless and efficient tools that empower both traders and builders to innovate and scale within the ecosystem.
- Build a sustainable DEX, where value is distributed fairly to the community and reinvested into Mantraâ€™s long-term growth.
- Become the default liquidity layer, serving not only end-users but also the projects and protocols building on Mantra.
- And ultimately, develop advanced features that align with a long-term vision for a transparent, secure, and RWA-powered DeFi market.

Lotus is not just a place to trade. We are building the foundational liquidity layer, where every swap, every pool, and every product contributes to shaping the future of DeFi connected to real-world assets on Mantra.
